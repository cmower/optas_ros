# optas_ros

**This is a development branch and will not be merged with the master branch. Our intention is to provide a working version of optas_ros for ROS Noetic, but will continue to support a ROS2 version.**

This package provides a ROS interface for the [OpTaS Library](https://github.com/cmower/optas).
